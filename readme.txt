Note the modified Three.js version used by the PanoPaintApp_v2.html called "three.colin.min.js".  It takes UV raycasting code from the latest dev release of three.js and incorporates it within three.js r.71 in order to detect UV locations with raycasting.

The goal of the application is to allow 3d spherical map painting without having to accomodate the normal equirectangular distortions needed to map images to a sphere.
